# Presentation

## What is it?

Null to web(site) is a workshop on creating your very first website. Within a workday, one without any prior skills will be able to write HTML and deploy it, so it is publicly available. The tools and skills used are used in real-world web development. Therefore end results will, may, be indistinguishable from professionally made websites.

The primary aim is to get people across the initial hurdle. To get a taste of web development and the satisfactory feeling of having a successful deploy.

## What is it not?

It is not a traineeship, nor will it bring participants to a skill level to
start applying for internships. Using the tools provided, one will be able to extend to their website beyond the scope of the workshop. Moving on to a more advanced setup might prove to be too much of a challenge.
